# Advanced Go Patterns for Cloud-Native Applications

Welcome to the **Advanced Go Patterns for Cloud-Native Applications** repository! This project serves as a collection of advanced patterns and best practices in Go, specifically tailored for cloud-native architectures. Whether you're working on distributed systems, microservices, or highly concurrent applications, these patterns can help you build reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.

## Introduction

This project is closely tied to my [personal blog](https://gabrieldillenburg.com/), where I explore advanced topics in software engineering, particularly with a focus on Go. Here, you'll find examples, code snippets, and practical demonstrations of Go patterns that are essential for building modern, cloud-native applications.

If you're a software engineer looking to deepen your understanding of Go and how it can be leveraged in distributed and cloud-native environments, this project is for you!

## Why Cloud-Native Patterns in Go?

Go is a powerful language designed for modern computing, particularly for cloud-native and microservice-based architectures. Its simplicity, efficiency, and rich support for concurrency make it an ideal choice for systems that demand high performance and scalability. In this repository, you'll find patterns that address:

- Concurrency and parallelism (goroutines, channels, and more)
- Fault tolerance and resilience (circuit breakers, retries)
- Distributed system patterns (service discovery, load balancing)
- Performance optimization (memory management, CPU-bound workloads)
- Cloud-native concerns (containerization, orchestration, observability)

## Key Patterns Covered

Here are some of the advanced Go patterns you can expect to find:

- **Concurrency and Parallelism Patterns**: Leveraging Goâ€™s goroutines, channels, and sync primitives for efficient multi-threading.
- **Context and Cancellation**: Gracefully handling cancellations, timeouts, and context propagation in distributed systems.
- **Error Handling**: Robust techniques for error management in Go, including custom error types and stack traces.
- **Worker Pools**: Efficiently managing a pool of workers to handle tasks concurrently.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implementing token buckets and leaky buckets for rate-limiting in high-traffic applications.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Preventing cascading failures in distributed systems by implementing a circuit breaker.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff for failed requests.

Additional patterns and examples will be continuously added to this project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can clone the repository and run the provided examples as follows:

1. Clone the repository:

    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/GabrielDillenburg/advanced-go-patterns.git
    cd advanced-go-patterns
    \`\`\`

2. Run the examples:

    \`\`\`bash
    go run examples/concurrency-patterns/main.go
    \`\`\`

    Each directory contains specific examples and implementations of the advanced Go patterns. Make sure to navigate to the relevant example and follow the instructions provided in the respective README files.
